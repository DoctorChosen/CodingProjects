package RainMonthlyArray;

//Write a RainFall program that stores the total rainfall for each of 12 months into an array of doubles.
//The program should have methods that return the following:
//* The total rainfall for the year
//* The average monthly rainfall
//* The name of the month with the most rain
//* The name of the month with the least rain
//Demonstrate program. Input Validation should not allow negative numbers.
